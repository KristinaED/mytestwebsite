	<h1> Kristina </h1>
	<p> This is a webpage about myself. I have never created a website before, so please excuse its simplicity. I would love to learn more about web development, and hopefully create a modern and fully functional website one day. Let's cross fingers.</p>
	<p> I like food. Healthy food is great. But sometimes a burger isn't bad either. </p>
